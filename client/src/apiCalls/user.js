// proxy in client/package.json is set to http://localhost:8081
// so the request will be made to http://localhost:8081/api/users/register
// Proxy is used to forward the request from the client to the server
// This is done to avoid CORS errors
// CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
// It is a security feature implemented in browsers
// It prevents requests from one origin to another
// For example, if you're on http://localhost:3000
// You cannot make a request to http://localhost:8081
// This is a security feature to prevent malicious attacks
// But in development, we need to make requests to different ports
// So we use a proxy to forward the request to the server
// This is only for development
// In production, the client and server will be on the same domain
// So there will be no CORS issues
